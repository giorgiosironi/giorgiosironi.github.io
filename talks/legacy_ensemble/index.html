              Whether I am in the role of a senior engineer or as a formal tech lead, I works hands on writing code with everyone else. But I usually dedicate myself to the overlooked problems of the first derivative: non-functional requirements such as testability, maintainability, or performance.
              Besides growing software, and growing people, I also try to grow some plants. In this phase I find the organic growth metaphor more realistic than all the software engineering ones I've encountered over the years.

A (often quickly) rotating Voice connects the Heads to the Hands, and ensures what's happening is understandable to the group. The Voice having to find consensus across the group on what to do next cannot be underestimated: they are channeling rather than leading.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">
              Every time you mention (even just) pair programming, especially in very hierarchical context, someone will say "isn't it wasteful?"
              You can get a lot done on your own. But what if there is a lot of work in this area, and we need more people to work on it? Are you the only one that can touch that code, forever? How difficult it feels to have to take all the decisions? And make lots of assumptions to be verified or reviewed later?

              Multiple contributions from an ensemble can lead to a better result. We see this as everyone either contributing or learning. From stepping on each other's toes to making a mosaic of good ideas. You can lose hours on a problem that another person would know how to solve in seconds, or know how to avoid in the first place.
              Needless to say, this goes hand in hand with continuous code review over the rework that would happen on feature branches after comments arrive. It is enabled by trunk-based development, and it allows Continuous Delivery.
              Where two programmers go faster and produce a higher quality result than one, what about three, or four?

            <aside class="notes">A classic onboarding pattern when joining a new team or organization: make a small change and follow it through the processes of code review, QA, deployment until you can see it in production. Lets you discover what supporting system are in place, what is the model for contribution, all while removing the variable of getting software design right for a new feature. In our team's case, it was a bug fix on a UI label that should have been highlighted in the presence of a derived word, "convincingly", rather than just for the original adjective "convincing".</aside>

            <aside class="notes">Develop a feature where there isn't great uncertainty in design, and making change to more than one repository or service is required. Develop outside in from the UI downwards to only write necessary code. Similar to the walking skeleton in spirit, as it aims to remove the integration risks. Prevent unnecessary work though, as we start to optimize the developer experience where we are feeling the pain. So it's less about delivery, and more about using this delivery as an opportunity to improve tooling and processes (as we should always be doing).</aside>

              Enabled by the code review provided constantly by the ensemble working together.

            <aside class="notes">
              In waterfall (more a theoretical thing) you work in the dark for a certain amount of time, then you deliver. You only need to e.g. test, or deploy successfully, once. Realized value is usually lower because we got something wrong and we can't incorporate the feedback as we spent all available time or budget.
              In agile processes, we deliver increments and so some value is delivered sooner. It doesn't mean that we code/test/deploy necessarily faster. But we can respond to feedback. Yet we have transaction costs on running tests every few seconds, or deploying tens of times per day.

            <aside class="notes">
              Agile coaches rightly say "you need to constantly refactor and keep the internal quality high to remain Agile". Keeping the cost of change low is a major objective in incremental development, even if the requirements don't end up changing.
              Before even talking about delivering new features, however we need to have local exploratory testing and a feedback loop of checks that enables us to commit changes safely. You can't even refactoring to make changes easier if you can't run the tests.
