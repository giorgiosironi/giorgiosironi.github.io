From soloists to ensemble 
- initial slide: musical ensemble picture
- who am I
- context (where am I?)
-- cross-functional team: developers with specialisms, product manager, outreach/marketing person
--- plus designer, data scientist
-- TypeScript, container-based infrastructure, monorepo

A DEFINITION
-- working on the same thing at the same time
-- anything that happens is verbalized first through a navigator
- metaphors
-- driver/navigator(s)
-- swarm
-- ensemble

A LABORATORY FOR TEAM DYNAMICS
-- storming and norming
--- adjustment to a day of constant interaction; outlets for breaks and solo hours
-- psychological safety
--- higher in the ensemble that in a wider group; let most of the problems be raised in context rather than in a dreaded 121 at the end of the week
-- Fear Of Missing Out
-- ideal for leaders (not just managers) to observe group dynamics that would be hidden in ad-hoc meetings or tickets
-- ENERGY LEVELS* (not sure where to fit this)
--- from 2 to 5 people; what hats can be worn in addition to driver and navigator
---- observing process; observing people; getting information or requesting it, etc see file:///home/giorgio/benne-sheats-group-roles-task-personal-dysfunctional-toolshero.jpg

BRIDGE: but what if it's remote?

THE REMOTENESS OF IT
-- driver: is sharing their screen
-- navigator: is explicitly collecting group input and directing the driver
-- everyone has their own screen, OS, keyboard, mouse, chair, ... so much simpler than in person
--- and everyone is on equal footing; no hybrid 2 people in a room and 2 people remote as it complicates communication
-- never run out of physical resources e.g. whiteboard space and marker, post its
--- related: reduced friction in writing lots of post its and throwing them away to support reasoning or communication
-- overlapping voices: contention of the single audio medium is possible
--- corollary: someone might hear overlapping voices where you don't. Experience is even more personal
-- no side conversations; impacting workshops rather than ensemble/navigator work

BRIDGE: let's connect this to some theory, or patterns...

COLLECTIVE CODE OWNERSHIP
-- continuous code review over rework on feature branches
-- widen bus factor* (negative connotation) over knowledge silos
-- multiple contributions for a better result over not stepping on each other's toes
-- how to work outside the mob? research and spikes, summarize knowledge to bring back

METHODOLOGY
-- resonance with XP
--- Communication is synchronous and constant
--- Simplicity comes from a diverse (in background, specialism, seniority) team looking for the simple, not easy, solution
-- resonance with Lean
--- eliminate partially done work, handoffs from one person to the next
--- no task switching: one-piece flow; minimize waiting times
--- "unteaming"/scatter-gather
- recruitment&onboarding
-- range of non-technical skills to look for
--- (verbal) communication; collaboration; behaviors that aid psychological safety
-- interview process
--- include ensembling after an initial screen
-- work in the ensemble from first days
--- feedback: makes you feel part of the team
--- covers the pull-based and not the curriculum-based part
