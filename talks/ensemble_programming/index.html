              I search for the harmony between form and context, which is a fancy way of saying I build software to fit in the world I'm in and all the forces around it. Over the years, I started contributing to building the team and the process as well, as they are the conduit to achieve something we can't do alone.

              Navigating and writing code are only a couple of the things that happen in an ensemble. Whether we realize it or not, we are often playing various roles that are not producing code directly. For example, a Nose notices smell in the code; an Archivist takes notes in an architectural diagram or TODO items for later; a Sponsor makes less loud voices heard.
