              I search for the harmony between form and context, which is a fancy way of saying I build software to fit in the world I'm in and all the forces around it. Over the years, I started contributing to building the team and the process as well, as they are the conduit to achieve something we can't do alone.

            <h2>Metaphors</h2>
            <aside class="notes">There are some concrete rules to follow when practicing ensemble programming. But even if we were to work all together on a piece of code during this talk, it might not get across the spirit behind them that makes them powerful, and adaptable to new contexts.</aside>

              All the brilliant people working on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer. -- Woody Zuill
            </blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">There are some constraints placed on a group of people to say they are working as a mob. They must be working on the same piece of software. They must be working in the same hours. They must be in a space where they can communicate synchronously with each other. And, given how linearizable committing code is, they should all work on a single working copy of a repository at a time.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">Being together doesn't necessarily lead to a productive result without building in some facilitation rules. To make everything that happens explicit and visible, it can be agreed by the group and verbalized to someone else. A (often quickly) rotating Voice connects the Heads to the Hands.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">A metaphor that is seen a wider usage nowadays is that of a musical ensemble. People have (overlapping) specialties. They must all be playing together in the same space at the same time and with great harmony for a good result that is more than what each of them could achieve alone. And this is different from an orchestra that has a conductor as a single point of failure.</aside>

              Moreover, navigating and writing code are only a couple of the things that happen in an ensemble. Whether we realize it or not, we are often playing various roles that are not producing code directly. For example, a Nose notices smell in the code; an Archivist takes notes in an architectural diagram or TODO items for later; a Sponsor makes less loud voices heard.
