              Navigating and writing code are only a couple of the things that happen in an ensemble. Whether we realize it or not, we are often playing various roles that are not producing code directly. For example, a Nose notices smell in the code; an Archivist takes notes in an architectural diagram or TODO items for later; a Sponsor makes less loud voices heard.
